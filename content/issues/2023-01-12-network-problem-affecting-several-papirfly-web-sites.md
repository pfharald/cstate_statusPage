## Summary

Our hosting provider checked their network for anomalies and found signs of resource limits in a firewall. The firewall logs have been sent to the vendor for further analysis and the firewalls were upgraded and restarted during a planned maintenance window on Thursday evening. 

The network instability occurred between 15:48:40 and 16:20:40 CEST on Thursday 2022-10-06.

*Investigating* - Some Papirfly services started responding slower than usual. It appears to be caused by network instability. We are investigating together with our hosting provider. {{< track "2022-10-06 13:53:00" >}}

*Monitoring* - All Papirfly services are working normally again. We are following the situation and investigating the root cause of the earlier disruption. {{< track "2022-10-06 14:20:00" >}}
