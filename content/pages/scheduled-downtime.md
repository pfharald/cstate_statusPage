## Scheduled downtime

There are two regular scheduled maintenance windows where the Papirfly service may be affected without further warning:

1. Every Monday 06:00-07:00 CET for security updates.
2. Every Thursday 23:00-01:00 CET for network maintenance.

If scheduled downtime outside these maintenance windows is needed, we'll announce this at least 48 hours in advance on [Papirfly Status](https://status.papirfly.com/ "Papirfly Status").

You can check [Papirfly Status](https://status.papirfly.com/ "Papirfly on-prem Status") for current and historical status (100 days).
