To find out which web hotel you are hosted on, you can "ping" your web site address; this will show the name and IP address of your web hotel. For example, on a Windows PC, to find out which web hotel the site www.papirfly.no is hosted on

```
C:\> ping demo.papirfly.com
Pinging juliet.papirfly.no [212.33.138.169] with 32 bytes of data: ...
```

Looking up the name juliet.papirfly.no and IP address 212.33.138.169 above, you can see that the site demo.papirfly.no is hosted on juliet.papirfly.no, which is an alias for pf-web6. You can also see that the IP address is 212.33.138.169 which is one of the IP addresses that belong to pf-web6.

Note that the above command may fail with a message like "Request timed out" (or something similar). This could be caused by networking restrictions somewhere between you and our servers. Despite this message, you should still be able to find out which web hotel your web site is hosted on.
